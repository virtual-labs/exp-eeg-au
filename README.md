### About the Experiment 

â€‹The "Temporal Structure in EEG" experiment, part of Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham's Virtual Lab, focuses on analyzing the temporal dynamics of event-related EEG data. It enables users to visualize event-related potentials (ERPs) like N200 and P300, which are elicited during sensory, cognitive, or motor tasks. This experiment aids in understanding the temporal characteristics of single-trial EEG data within short time windows and assists in characterizing the amplitude variations in specific EEG wave components in response to cognitive activities
