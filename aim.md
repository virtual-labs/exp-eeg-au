•	To understand the spatio-temporal changes of an event related EEG data.

•	Visualize event-related potential (ERP) evoked by cognitive performance such as sensory, cognitive or motor tasks.

•	Understand temporal characteristics of single-trial EEG data in a short time window. 

•	Characterize temporal amplitudes in EEG wave components such as N200, P300 in response to cognitive performances.
