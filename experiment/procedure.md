1.	User can upload raw EEG data of a motor imagery task in the GUI platform. 
2.	Select and tweak the shorter time windows in the GUI and characterize ERPâ€™s at different time bins.  
3.	User can choose single trial EEG data of motor imagery and visual imagery motor tasks. 
4.	The GUI platforms allows the comparison of temporal features of specific events (that is, motor planning, motor initiation, and motor execution) with respect to particular time windows. 
5.	User can also analyse the amplitude differences in positive and negative scale epochs for cognitive performances from the visualization plots.
